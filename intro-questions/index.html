    <h3>Intro Questions</h3>
    <p>1. My name is Mia Goldberg, my major is Communication Design, and I am a junior.</p>
    <p>2. I took Visual Principles for the Screen last year and I really loved that class. 
     <br>   That was mostly front end stuff, so I think this class will supplement that nicely and allow me to get the full picture of web design.</p>
     <p>3. I also took Introduction to Human Centered Design last year and we worked with HTML/CSS and JS. 
        <br> But that was mostly editing existing code and not as much starting it from scratch.</p>
    <p>4. In this class, I hope to become comfortable with HTML/CSS so that I can use it in a professional setting.
        <br> I hope that by the end of the class I can receive a set of instructions for a website and be able to implement them.</p>
    <p>5. Colors appear differently on screen than on paper. Text size also must be different for a successful reading experience.
        <br> Design for the screen also should be dynamic and suitable for changing the size of the screen, moving between different devices, etc.</p>
    <p>6. I think that the <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> website has very effective design. The color scheme and design style is consistent and eye-catching.
        <br> The typeface choice is readable and the hierarchy of information is clear.</p>
    <p>7. I think that the <a href="https://duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> website has very effective communication. The site starts with a specific call to action that explains its premise in a few words.
        <br> Then, the more you scroll, the more you can find out. It lists important information like what languages are available, how learning works, etc.</p>  
    <p>8. I think this <a href="https://coolors.co/33a329">Color Picker</a> works really well. Not only do you have a variety of ways to pick a color easily, the site gives you a name for the color along with its hex code in real time.
        <br> It also gives you shades, tints, and color harmonies that work with your chosen color. It checks contrast, and even gives you other options for similar colors!
