<h1 class=title>GARAGE ROOFTOP</h1>
<h2 class=subtitle>BY Q</h2>

<p class="lyrics"> 
Now we've <br>
Been in the middle <br>
Of a war we <br>
Could never handle <br>
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
But I got you <br>
And you got me <br>
Dancin' on the rooftop <br>
With the lights off <br>
With the moonlight <br>
You take the tears out <br>
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
So I've <br>
Been in the middle <br>
Of a crazy storm <br>
And you've <br>
Been on the rooftops <br>
You never back down <br>
You always make sure <br>
You never showdown <br>
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
I'ma cry, I'ma fall <br>
I'ma feel anxiety <br>
Inside of me <br>
Until I found <br>
You on the garage rooftop <br>
You on the garage rooftop <br>
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
And now we've <br>
Been in our mental <br>
And we never <br>
Could ever handle <br>
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
But I got you <br>
And you got mе <br>
Dancin' on the rooftop <br>
With the lights off <br>
With the moonlight <br>
You takе the tears out <br>
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
So I've <br>
Been in the middle <br>
Of a crazy storm <br>
And you've <br>
Been on the rooftops <br>
You never back down <br>
You always make sure <br>
You never showdown <br>
I've <br>
Been in the middle <br>
Of a crazy storm <br>
And you've <br>
Been on the rooftops <br>
You never back down <br>
You always make sure <br>
You never showdown <br>
